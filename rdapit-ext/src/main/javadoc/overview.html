	The RDA PIT API provides facilities to query and manipulate typed
	information available from persistent identifiers and shared through
	type registries.

	<h2>Testing</h2>
	Testing can be done using mvn test.<br />
	However, testing requires an accessible Handle Server v8 instance and a Type Registry instance. 
	The configuration for these (IP addresses, credentials) must be provided through a property file.
	The name of this file must be passed as a Java property using a '-D' switch to mvn test; 
	the name of the property is 'pitapi.testingconfig'. An example file can be found in the source code root 
	(testing.properties.example). Note that the addresses given in there are outdated and will not work anymore.<br/>
	Alternatively, all properties in the properties file can be passed using '-D' switches.
	
	<h2>Deployment</h2>
	
	<p>Deploying the API prototype requires access to a Handle System 8 server and a Type Registry instance.</p>
	
	<p>The current API prototype uses the interface to an older version of the type registry under development by CNRI at <a href="http://typeregistry.org">typeregistry.org</a>.
	The older version may still be available at <a href="http://38.100.130.13:8002/registrar">http://38.100.130.13:8002/registrar</a>; an adaption to the newer interface may be available from the PIT git repository.<br/>
	At time of writing, the Handle System 8 has not been publicly released. Some closed beta servers may be available for instance from members of the <a href="http://www.pidconsortium.eu">European Persistent Identifier Consortium</a>.</p>
	

	The API prototype was written using
	<a href="http://jersey.java.net" target="_blank">Jersey 2</a> based on
	JAX-RS 2.0. The project offers full support for
	<a href="http://maven.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Maven</a>.
	<br /> The following instructions assume deployment on an
	<a href="http://tomcat.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Tomcat 8</a>
	application server.
	<ol>
		<li>Use the following call to generate a <i>web application
				archive (war) file</i>: <pre>
$ mvn war:war
</pre>
		</li>

		<li>The REST service must be configured properly so it knows
			which identifier service and type registry to contact.<br> An
			example configuration file in Java's properties file format can be
			found <a href="resources/pitapi.properties.example" target="_blank">here</a>.
			Copy it to <code>/usr/local/rda/pitapi.properties</code> and make
			sure the application server's user has sufficient permissions to read it.
			Also update it with the addresses of the Handle System 8 instance and possibly the Type Registry.
			The config file contains the same properties that are also used for testing.
		</li>

		<li>Deploy the generated war file on your application server.</li>

		<li>A simple test to verify that the API is running properly can
			be made by calling the {@link
			rdapit.rest.TypingRESTResource#simplePing ping} method: <pre>
$ curl http://your.server/your.application.path/pitapi/ping
Hello World
</pre>
		</li>
	</ol>
