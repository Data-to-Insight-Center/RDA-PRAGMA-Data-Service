# RDA-PRAGMA-Data-Service

RDA-PRAGMA-Data-Service is designed for users to quick access biodiversity data objects metadata and lineage. It also provides data comparison service to detect if output has been updated due to possible mutations. It is composed of a three-layer architecture:

1. Backend layer: Backend layer includes one persistent MongoDB service which is served as metadata repository and file archive which hosts biodiversity objects.
2. Middle Layer: Middle layer includes web service using Spring framework which responds to queries or ingestions by accessing backend mongoDB and file archive.
3. Frontend Layer: Frontend layer includes UI design and JS scripts which send AJAX call to middle layer web services.

Here is a general architecture graph for Lifemapper Landing page:
