# RDA-PRAGMA-Data-Service

RDA-PRAGMA-Data-Service is designed for users to quickly manage their valueable data objects and boost up sharing and accessibility using two RDA techniques: Persistent Identifier Information Type (PIT) and Data Type Registry (DTR). 
It is composed of a three-layer architecture:

1. Backend layer: Backend layer includes one persistent MongoDB service which is served as metadata repository and file archive which hosts data objects;
2. Middleware Layer: Middle layer includes web service using Rest Web Service framework which responds to queries or ingestions; Middleware layer also communicates with DTR and PIT service;
3. Frontend Layer: Frontend layer includes UI design and JS scripts which send AJAX call to middle layer web services and display response in users' bro

Here are general timeline diagrams to describe RDA-PRAGMA Data Service user flow:

#Installation Guide

## Software Dependencies

1. Apache Maven V3.0 or higher
2. JDK V1.6 or higher
3. Python V2.6 or higher 
4. MongoDB Server V3.0 or higher
5. JavaScript V1.8.0 or higher

## Hardware Requirements

1. This software can be deployed on physical resources or VM instance with public network interface.
2. For public access, it requires 3 ports (backend repo, web service APIs, UIs) which iptables rules allow traffic through the firewall.

##Building the Source
Check Out Source Codes:
```
git clone https://github.com/Data-to-Insight-Center/RDA-PRAGMA-Data-Service.git
```

```
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=Data-Service-server/lib/handle-client.jar -DgroupId=Handle.net -DartifactId=handle-client â€”Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar
```

Edit the MongoConfig.xml file found under src/main/resources and set your backend mongoDB uri with username/password if exists.
```
vi Data-Service-server/src/main/resources/MongoConfig.xml
```
Edit the SpringConfig.properties file under src/main/resources; set PIT/DTR uri and set middleware web service server address and port
```
vi Data-Service-server/src/main/resources/SpringConfig.properties
```

Build RDA-PRAGMA Data Service 
```
mvn clean install
```
If you want to skip maven test, run the following cmd:
``` 
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

##Deploy Data Service server using nohup
